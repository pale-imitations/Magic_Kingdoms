# Magic_Kingdoms
This mod adds:

=> Wands which draw from a player's mana, as well as mechanics for learning a swapping between 58 spells, using Necromancy, Summoning, Transfiguration, Banishment, Binding, Elemental, Life, Death, and Chaos magic

=> A new structure called the Summoner's Pyramid that allows one to duplicate a creature, similar to a mob spawner

=> A brand new potion system, centered around an improved Cauldron, the Mystic Cauldron. Allowing you to brew potions with multiple effects, and with 58 potion effects to choose from the possibilities are endless.

=> Magical teas, which grant weak potion effects, brewed from herbs found around the world.

=> Charms made from gems which allow you to cast particular spells without the use of your limited pool of mana

=> 12 new crops, +20 new ores, a new armor and toolset, new traps, blocks, items, and 44 new potion effects

=> And finally, a new dungeon structure called the Ziggurat, which houses a deadly maze, 20 randomly generated challenge rooms, and a deadly Boss Monster at the end, the Demon of the Ziggurat, a magic-user and the only known owner of the Dark Spellbook, the Infernal Diabolis Occultum. This structure is made more dangerous by the Demon Heart that beats at the center of the Ziggurat which curses the whole structure making it unbreakable to any trespassers. Enter at your own risk.

 

This mod is still incomplete so expect more additions as I continue to work on it. Plans include:

=> A mini-Boss the Tarantula of the Webbed Forest, from whom you may earn a pet spider

=> Three new races of NPCs, the Centaurs, the Merpeople, and the Humans, which will be more advanced than the typical villager as they will hunt, mine, eat, explore, and can be befriended to find a powerful ally. They will be found in Kingdoms, which will have their own politics and may even go to war against each other

=> More advanced witches and magician NPCs

=> Magical specialties and much more.
